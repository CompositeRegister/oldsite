    <h2>Field Day 2021 <span class="date" >6/26/2021 8:31PM EST</span></h2>
    <p class="pp">This year I attended ARRL Field Day 2021. Being newly licensed, this is has been my first Field Day, and I found the experience enjoyable. For Field Day, I went to Alliance and joined in to the Field Day being hosted by <a href="http://www.w8lky.org/">Alliance Amateur Radio Club (W8LKY)</a>. There were quite a couple HF rigs and I was setup with someone to listen, although I cannot seem to remember his call. Ronald (KE8HCY) was greatful enough to provide me a packet to print off to study for my General class license. Calls were exchanged between people in other states and countries. Overall, I had a great time although I wish I stayed longer, and I am now a member of the Alliance club and look forward to attending future meetings.</p>

    <h2>Baofeng UV-5R <span class="date" >6/24/2021 6:53PM EST</span></h2>
    <p>This is my first (and currently only) radio. While it is a great beginner radio, it is certainly not the best. The device emits spuirious emissions, and one of these emissions happens to be 442MHz, which happens to be the output frequency of the WB8OVQ repeater that I like to monitor, so the green receive light is always illuminated. However, the radio does its job and I can produce a decent signal and get fair range. I seldomly use the stock rubber ducky antenna, and instead opt to use a Nagoya NA-711 antenna, which grants me a small improvement in range. I also have a somewhat of a tape measure antenna, but being nearly 43cm long, it is a bit of an overkill for the Baofeng, although it does grant me just a small but of extra range compared to the Nagoya antenna. For something that can be picked up for just over $20 new, I feel that it is a great entry level radio.</p>
