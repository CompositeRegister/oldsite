    <h4>Field Day 2021 (Posted 6/24/2021 7:41PM EST)</h4>
    <p class="pp">This year I will be attending Field Day with the <a href="http://www.w8lky.org/">Alliance Amateur Radio Club (W8LKY)</a>. This will be my first field day, and I am excited to meet some folks and to watch some HF operations. I don't have much to say, but I will give feedback on my experience here once the event is over.</p>

    <h4>Baofeng UV-5R (Posted 6/24/2021 6:53PM EST)</h4>
    <p>This is my first (and currently only) radio. While it is a great beginner radio, it is certainly not the best. The device emits spuirious emissions, and one of these emissions happens to be 442MHz, which happens to be the output frequency of the WB8OVQ repeater that I like to monitor, so the green receive light is always illuminated. However, the radio does its job and I can produce a decent signal and get fair range. I seldomly use the stock rubber ducky antenna, and instead opt to use a Nagoya NA-711 antenna, which grants me a small improvement in range. I also have a somewhat of a tape measure antenna, but being nearly 43cm long, it is a bit of an overkill for the Baofeng, although it does grant me just a small but of extra range compared to the Nagoya antenna. For something that can be picked up for just over $20 new, I feel that it is a great entry level radio.</p>
